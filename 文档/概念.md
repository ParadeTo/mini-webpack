### webpack
webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes
your application, it internally builds a dependency graph from one or more entry points and 
then combines every module your project needs into one or more bundles, which are static 
assets to serve your content from.

### loader
Out of the box, webpack only understands JavaScript and JSON files. Loaders allow webpack to 
process other types of files and convert them into valid modules that can be consumed by your
application and added to the dependency graph.
 
One of webpack's specific features is the ability to import any type of module, e.g. .css files, which may not be 
supported by other bundlers or task runners

### plugins
While loaders are used to transform certain types of modules, plugins can be leveraged to perform a wider range of tasks 
like bundle optimization, asset management and injection of environment variables.
